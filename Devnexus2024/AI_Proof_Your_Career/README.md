# Slides for the 2024 Devnexus presentation "AI Proof Your Career With Software Architecture"

This directory contains the Apple Keynote file containing the slides for the presentation. I also exported it to a PDF file (with presenter notes), although the actual talk was more detailed (and had a lot of jokes).

I hope you enjoyed this talk and found it useful. If you have any comments or suggestions, please feel free to contact me! My contact information is on the last slide (or last page of the PDF document).
