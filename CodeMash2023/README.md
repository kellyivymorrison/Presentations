# CodeMash 2023 Presentation

This is an updated version of a presentation on the Visitor design pattern that I gave
at the CodeMash conference in Sandusky, Ohio, in January of 2023.

I added a few slides on ChatGPT3 since then (showing refined prompts) and added a link
to this GitHub repository on the "keep in touch" slide at the end.

You'll find the Apple Keynote slide deck here, as well as two PDFS (one with just the
slides, the other with smaller versions of the slides accompanied by notes).
