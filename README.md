# Presentations

## CodeMash 2023

This directory contains the slides for a presentation on the **Visitor design pattern**
that I gave at the CodeMash conference in Sandusky, Ohio in January of 2023. It has
been updated since then to add a few more slides on using ChatGPT3, and I added a 
QR code link to this GitHub repository on the "keep in touch" slide at the end.
